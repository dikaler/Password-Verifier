# Password Verifier

This project is a Password Verifier implemented using HTML and CSS. The user is prompted to enter a password to check its strength. There are several requirements that the user should achieve inorder to create a strong password. As the user implements each of the requirements, they are dynamically checked off. Once the user implements all requirements, a message will be revealed that a strong password was created.
